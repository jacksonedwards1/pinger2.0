Pinger 2.0 is a program that allows the user to seamlessly ping a network device from the Chick-fil-A store of their choosing.

## Installation

Double-click the .exe file and request Bit9 approval. Once this is completed, it is recommended to add a shorcut to your startup file so that Pinger 2.0 is always running when you need it.

## Usage

Once the program is running, press `ALT + P` at any time to call Pinger 2.0. Once the program is open... 

1. Enter the 5-digit store number into the first prompt.
2. Select the network device you'd like to ping.
3. Check whether you'd like to ping the device continuously.
4. Click `PING!`
