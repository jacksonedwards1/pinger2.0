Pinger 2.0 is a program that allows the user to seamlessly ping a network device from the Chick-fil-A store of their choosing.

## Installation

Double-click the .exe file and request Bit9 approval. Once this is completed, it is recommended to add a program shorcut to your startup file so that Pinger 2.0 is always running when you need it.  

Please do not move any files outside of the Pinger 2.0 folder as you will start to get error messages and the program may not work as designed.

## Usage

>*NOTE: Be sure you are connected to Banyan or COWS before use.*

Once the program is running, press `ALT + P` at any time to call Pinger 2.0. Once the program is open... 

1. Enter the 5-digit store number into the first prompt.
2. Select the network device you'd like to ping.
3. Check whether you'd like to ping the device continuously.
4. Click `PING!`
